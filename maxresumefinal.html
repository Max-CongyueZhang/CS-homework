        <p class="a">
        Regarding academics, I mastered algebra, plane geometry,           and mechanics. Also, I can apply multivariable-calculus,           linear algebra, elementary probability theory, statistics,         solid geometry, and electromagnetism. Besides, I have              experience in basic orbital mechanics. Generally, I am             skilled at analyzing problems and offering solutions; in           addition, I am positive and hardworking.
